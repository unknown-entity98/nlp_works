# nlp_works

This reposity contains my work and exploration in the field of NLP.
1. It will begin the basic language modelling concepts such as n-gram, tf-idf, and bag of words.
2. From there it will move on the complex representations such as CBOW (continuous bag of words), skip-gram, and FastText.
3. it will contain my work on LSTM and RNNs for text generation and summarization.
4. From there, I will move on to the complex (`and newly proposed variants of the RNN -- yes I recently came across the LSGRU in an article related to cloud computing! can you believe that they would combine an LSTM and GRU in such a manner??`) variants of the RNN.
5. this repository will also feature my work on transformers
